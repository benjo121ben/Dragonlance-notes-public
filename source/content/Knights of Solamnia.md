# General Info
## Est Sularus oth Mithas
- most well-known and, depending on the era of their history, respected or reviled military order on [[Ansalon]]
- Whatever the age or the situation, however, the Knights try their best to hold on to the oath that is the backbone of their lives: “**My honor is my life.**” "**Est Sularus oth Mithas**"
- The Oath, “Est Sularus oth Mithas,” or “My Honor is My Life,” is the creed by which all Knights of Solamnia attempt to live their lives. However, the Knighthood does have a set of laws - [[the Measure]] - designed to guide the Knights in living up to the Oath. Started by [[Vinas Solamnus]], the Measure is a collection of the rules and laws of the Knighthood. Each Order has its own Measure, though all Solamnic Knights are expected to follow the whole of the Measure at all times. Currently the Measure occupies 37 large volumes
- Knights were formed around 2000 years ago by [[Vinas Solamnus]] to be the pinnacle of all that is good and honorable, defenders of the weak, and protectors of [[Ansalon]]

## The Three Orders
The Knighthood is made up of three Orders, the **Crown**, **Sword**, and **Rose**. Each Order is dedicated to one of the **three gods** who appeared to Vinas Solamnus, inspiring the creation of the Knights.
